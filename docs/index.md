# Welcome

Hi there! :wave:

This is my personal website. It is a combination of:

* A blog featuring posts about a mix of my personal interests (such as astronomy, languages, computer science, technology, clean code, and more)
* In-depth documentation of my personal projects, including:
    * The [RST-Tace](https://github.com/tkutschbach/RST-Tace) implementation
    * Some upcoming machine learning projects

Kudos to the [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) project and [Arthur Picerna](https://dev.to/ar2pi) for the [guide](https://dev.to/ar2pi/publish-your-markdown-docs-on-github-pages-6pe) that served as the foundation for this website.

Enjoy!
