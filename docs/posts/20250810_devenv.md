# Development Environment for Machine-Learning Projects

In the upcoming time I will pursue a couple machine learning projects. 
These will be documented here it detail, but first things first: How to set up a development environment for private machine learnings projects?

There a couple of options that come to mind ...

1. Building a Machine-Learning PC
2. Working on a VM-instnce in a cluster with GPU support
3. Working completely in Google Colab
4. ...

... and probably lots of more. What option to got for depends heavily on the use-cases and requirements.

My setup will be the following:

1. Large datasets shall be stored on a gloud storage
2. All the code will be hosted on a GitHub repository
3. The actual develop work (i.e., data analysis, data processing,  iteration on model architectures and the training) will be done on a linux VM
4. The training process itself shall be done using GoogleColab
